Either place here the 3D files (if they are small enough to fit on your harddrive) or place your files on any external hard drive and make a link to the external harddrive instead.

Save the 3D data sorted by channel (e.g. green, orange, ... or call it WT, wisp,...)
The data itself can be a time series (T,z,y,x), channel size = 1
